# KievRest
- New project that will help cityzents to find places where to rest and where to go alone or with friends.
- Great matirial design and many categories to choose.

# Project setup
# 1. Download and install Java Developer Kit and Android Studio
- Android Studio requires Java 7 to run so you will need to make sure you have java installed before proceeding. Download and install JDK 7 and make note of its installation location. Android Studio will ask for this path once you import the theme template. Once the JDK is installed you will need to download and install Android Studio, making sure you meet the system requirements listed on the Android Studio page prior to downloading. After installing Android Studio you will need to add an SDK by following these instructions. Make note of the location that the SDK is installed to as this will be needed once you import the theme template.

# 4. Build and test

 - Android Studio makes it easy to quickly build and test your theme on your device. First, make sure your device is plugged in to a USB port on your computer. Second, verify that adb is working correctly with the device that you plugged in. See this guide for more information on setting up and troubleshooting ADB.

 - Now that your device is plugged in and ready to go, simply press the green play button located in the toolbar.
